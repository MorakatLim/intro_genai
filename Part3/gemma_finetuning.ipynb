    "In this notebook, you will learn how to fine-tune a large language model (Google's Gemma) for a specific task. The notebook covers the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up the environment\n",
    "2. Initializing the GPU and configuring LoRA settings for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "3. Loading the pre-trained Gemma model and testing its performance\n",
    "4. Preparing a diverse dataset of question-answer pairs covering various domains\n",
    "5. Fine-tuning the model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` class\n",
    "6. Evaluating the fine-tuned model on a test dataset\n",
    "7. Saving and loading the fine-tuned model for future use\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how fine-tuning can enhance a model's performance on a diverse range of topics, making it more versatile and applicable to various domains. You will gain insights into the process of creating a **task-specific model** that can provide accurate and relevant responses to a wide range of questions.\n",

This step is crucial because the LoRA weights contain the learned adaptations from the finetuning process. By merging the LoRA weights, we effectively incorporate the knowledge gained during finetuning into the base model. 🧠💡\n",
