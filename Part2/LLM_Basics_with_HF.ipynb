    "1. **Hugging Face Account:**  If you don't already have one, you can create a free Hugging Face account by clicking [here](https://huggingface.co/join).\n",
    "2. **LLM Model Access:** Head over to the [Gemma model page](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) and [llama2 model papge](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) and accept the usage conditions.\n",
    "3. **Hugging Face Token:**  You need to create a token on HuggingFace and use it to login from this notebook. Once you are logged in, you can download the models. Check [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) on how to create a token on HF. Generate a Hugging Face access (preferably `write` permission) token by clicking [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). **Save the token in a safe document that you can access**. Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to move on to the next section where we'll install necessary packages and log into HuggingFace Hub.\n"

    "\n",
    "Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
